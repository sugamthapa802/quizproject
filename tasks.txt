Tasks left:
    create more topics
    list their csv files
    load them in database

more features :
    review wrong questions:
        choose which topic(input)
            query for that topic.example(WrongAnswer.objects.filter(Q(user=request.user)&Q(question__topic='input')))


just make sure that the csv files dont have any quotes
check the ans are correct,unique and maybe just print 25 questions in a lot 
while importing the questions from csv file use " <refer to the object of topic in db> "
deploy the project.

delete all the questions from the db and start fresh,generate new questions in json format and convert in csv and paste


what i plan to do is :
    make a csv extracter to extract only ques and correct ans and check it in chatgpt
    only if correct:
        paste it in csv file(project)
        upload to db


workflow :
    generate ques from grok in json
    paste in geeksforgeeks to turn into csv
    convert csv to just questions and correct ans
    check that in gpt
    if correct :
        paste in orginal file.csv
